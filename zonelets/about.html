            Hi, I'm LunaFae and I'm the creator of this site! I'm a 20-something friendless girl who enjoys art, music, gaming and anime. I started making this site in early 2025 and I want my website to become a little personal creative hub where I'm going to try and start posting blogs and maybe some art? I want to be more creative in my life since it's good for my mental health and being creative genuinely makes me happy. I also want to share my art with people too. I hope that whoever comes across my website can appreciate and enjoy my work and maybe I could make some new friends with similar interests to me in this way? Who knows lol but either way, if you're reading this, I'm happy you're alive and may my humble abode on the Internet be a source of comfort and coziness to you!
